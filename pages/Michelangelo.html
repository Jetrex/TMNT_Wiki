    <h1>Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</h1>
    <!-- Paragraph 1 - Introduction -->
    <p><b>Michelangelo</b>, nicknamed <b>Mike</b> or <b>Mikey</b>, is a fictional superhero and one of the four main characters of the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> comics and all related media.
    </p>

    <p>
    He is usually depicted wearing an orange eye mask. His signature weapons are dual nunchaku, though he has also been portrayed using other weapons,
    such as a grappling hook, manriki-gusari, tonfa, and a three-section staff (in some action figures).
    </p>

    <p>Michaelangelo is the most naturally skilled of his four brothers, but prefers to have a good time rather than train. The youngest of the group he is shown to be rather immature, he is known for his wise-cracks, love of skateboarding, witty optimism and like his brothers love of pizza.
    </p>

    <p>Michelangelo was given a much bigger role in the <a href="/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1987_TV_series)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)">1987 cartoon series</a>, directed at a younger audience, than in the more serious <a href="/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(comic_book)" class="mw-redirect" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic book)">original comic books</a><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> which were aimed at an older audience. He often coins most of their catchphrases, such as "Cowabunga!". Like all of the brothers, he is named after a <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> artist; in this case, he is named after <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo Buonarroti</a>. His name was originally spelled Michaelangelo by the original creators, possibly misspelling his <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo" title="Michelangelo">name sake</a>'s name wrong due to the name "Michael" and how the name "Michael" is spelled. In the original comics, all The Turtles wear red masks, but to tell them apart, he was given an orange mask instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Comic books</h2><hr>
    <h3>Mirage Comics</h3>
    <p>
    In these original <a href="/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(Mirage_Studios)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)">comic books</a>, Michelangelo was initially depicted as fun-loving, carefree, and, while not as aggressive as <a href="/wiki/Raphael_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)" title="Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Raphael</a>, always ready to fight. He is much more serious-natured in the comic book than in the film incarnations, which have labeled his character a permanent "dude" talking teenager. It was Michelangelo's <a href="/wiki/One-shot_(comics)" title="One-shot (comics)">one-shot</a> in this series that fleshed out most of the traits that have become synonymous with the character, such as his playfulness, empathy, and easygoing nature. In the one-shot story, Michelangelo adopts a stray cat (which he names Klunk) and also stops thieves from stealing toys meant for orphaned children.
    </p>

    <p>
    After their defeat at the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Foot_Clan" title="Foot Clan">Foot Clan</a> the Turtles, <a href="/wiki/Splinter_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)" title="Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Splinter</a>, <a href="/wiki/April_O%27Neil" title="April O'Neil">April O'Neil</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Casey_Jones_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)" title="Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Casey Jones</a> retreat to a farm house in <a href="/wiki/Northampton,_Massachusetts" title="Northampton, Massachusetts">Northampton, Massachusetts</a> which used to belong to Casey's grandmother. While there, April is worried to note that Michelangelo is not himself. He spends his days in the barn taking out his aggression on a punching bag. A scene shows him lashing out at his surroundings and repeatedly punching the wall of the barn until it breaks, then collapsing on it despondently, anger spent. The end of the story implies that Michelangelo's sorrow and frustration have been resolved, as subsequent issues restore Michelangelo's more relaxed, optimistic personality.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is during the group's time at the farm we learn that Michelangelo also has an interest in comic books, specifically ones involving superheroes such as "The Justice Force" (comic book heroes based on <a href="/wiki/The_Justice_League" class="mw-redirect" title="The Justice League">The Justice League</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four" class="mw-redirect" title="The Fantastic Four">The Fantastic Four</a>). He also finds solace in writing fiction and has produced a story depicting himself as a <a href="/wiki/R%C5%8Dnin" title="Rōnin">rōnin</a> in <a href="/wiki/Feudal_Japan" class="mw-redirect" title="Feudal Japan">Feudal Japan</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the story arc <i>City at War</i>, Michelangelo instantly bonds with Casey Jones' adopted daughter Shadow, who nicknames him "Rooish". In the second volume, the Turtles decide to try to live apart from one another. Michelangelo, the social creature that he is, moves in with April and Casey so that he can be close to Shadow. Throughout the first two volumes, Michelangelo seemed to act as peacemaker of the team. These stories also laid the foundations which demonstrated his closeness with his older brother <a href="/wiki/Donatello_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)" title="Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Donatello</a>, their laid-back natures separating them from the more contentious <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)" title="Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Leonardo</a> and Raphael.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Volume 4, Michelangelo gets a job as a tour guide showing alien visitors around <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. His first (and only) tourist is the <i>Regenta</i> (or "princess") Seri of the Styracodon race. Michelangelo convinces Seri to sneak away from her bodyguards so that he can take her on a tour of the northwest coast of the USA.  Their relationship becomes more intimate apparently, when Seri delivers eggs that she claims are "their" children. Unfortunately, before much time is given for him to settle with this news Seri's bodyguards become aware of his machinations. They attack Michelangelo and transport him back to their home world, where he is placed in prison. With the help of a Triceraton prisoner named Azokk, he manages to escape, and is rescued by a group of Triceratons who came to rescue Azokk. The ordeal results in Mikey's personality taking a very dark turn, having been hardened by the cruelty of the extrajudicial prison and Azokk's death. Upon the Triceratons learning of Azokk's death, they declare war on the Styracodons and carry out a genocidal assault against them. Michelangelo, embittered by Seri's apparent betrayal, joins forces with the Triceratons and gladly aids them in acts of genocide against the Styracodons.

    <p>
    Michelangelo was not given an especially large role in Volumes 1 and 2, did little to advance the plot, and was often not portrayed as an especially skilled fighter. His relatively small role was probably due to the need to establish Leonardo's role as "leader" along with the fact that Donatello was Peter Laird's favorite Turtle, and Raphael was Kevin Eastman's favorite.

    <h3>Image Comics</h3>
    <p>
    In the comics published by <a href="/wiki/Image_Comics" title="Image Comics">Image Comics</a>, Michelangelo's interest in writing is expanded upon and he is established as a writer of fiction and poetry. During this series, Michelangelo develops a romantic relationship with <a href="/wiki/Horridus_(comics)" title="Horridus (comics)">Horridus</a>, whom he credits as his muse in writing. But the relationship wouldn't last, (as the story may have begun after Rapture's death), she started staying with Officer Dragon and had developed an attraction to him; though Dragon didn't know it himself. Michelangelo would be heartbroken when Sara dumps him. An early issue has him selling his first poem to a poetry digest. As the comic continued, Michelangelo's career as a writer gradually expanded. In the final issue, he has published his first novel, a romance called "A Rose Among the Thorns". April mentions that the book was already going back for a second printing and that she'd heard that <a href="/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> loved it, which "practically guarantees that it will be a best-seller." Michelangelo is the only Turtle who did not end up disfigured in some way in this series; Leonardo lost his left hand and had it replaced by a steel cap with a retractable blade, Raphael was facially disfigured after being shot in the face, and Donatello was transformed into a cyborg after being shot and thrown out of a helicopter. Mikey asked Sara for her hand in marriage but was denied.

    One of his many skills in the Archie comics was the ability to communicate with animals. In a story-line set in the future, Michelangelo is shown to have become an artist whose main job is running an orphanage.

    <h3>IDW Publishing</h3>
    <p>
    Michelangelo like his brothers was reincarnated into a turtle after he was slain by <a href="/wiki/Oroku_Saki" class="mw-redirect" title="Oroku Saki">Oroku Saki</a>. He is also the youngest turtle as shown in his human form when he was the only baby among his brothers. He is more mature in this incarnation than others, but is still sociable, for example, bonding with the <a href="/wiki/Mighty_Mutanimals" title="Mighty Mutanimals">Mighty Mutanimals</a> and with pizza boy Woody Dirkins. Unfortunately, Michelangelo's friendship with Woody waned, as shown in <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> Issue 15, when Slash frightened Woody and he left a note for Michelangelo stating that he couldn't handle the troubles that followed them. Michelangelo is good friends with all Mutanimals, but can be unsure about Old Hob, remembering how Hob had been their enemy. Further, Michelangelo was occasionally anxious about them, showing some concern in Issue 68, in which Hob told the Turtles that Slash had been mind-controlled, taken out all the Mutanimals, and helped capture them for the Earth Protection Force, as well as in Issue 70, in which Michelangelo wondered whether Slash would be okay. Michelangelo is also the most sensitive turtle: <i>e.g.</i>, in Issue 50 he couldn't handle Splinter accepting leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Foot_Clan" title="Foot Clan">Foot Clan</a>. In this incarnation, Michelangelo is not romantically interested in anyone except Neutrino: Princess Trib instead of Kala as in the 1987 TV series. When General Kraang was at war with the foot clan, Michelangelo supported Donatello's ideas for just about everything, as when Raphael introduced Donatello's tracking device (embedded in a shuriken) in the "Secret History of the Foot Clan". The after effects of the war left Michelangelo in a vulnerable position seeing as he was strict with Raphael when they were mourning Donnie's injuries. He also shows signs of intelligence when he decodes ancient Japanese text in the "<i>Ashi no Himitsu</i>" book that tells secrets of the Foot Clan. Furthermore he was not afraid to confront Splinter when their sensei had taken the orphans with him to prevent them from training as Foot Ninja. Eventually he convinced Splinter to listen to him and won their debate. Nonetheless Michelangelo is still as fun-loving a turtle as in other bodacious versions of himself.
