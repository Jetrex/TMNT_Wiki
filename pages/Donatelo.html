    in the comics, Donatello is depicted as the calmer turtle. While the comics portrayal of the team has no official command structure, 
    in the early stories he is depicted as second-in-command. In the first issue, he is the one that killed the Shredder by knocking him and his grenade off the roof. 
    The second issue elaborated more on each turtles' personalities and opened with Donatello soldering a circuit. Later in the issue, 
    Donatello states that he is "familiar with some computer systems" and helps April O'Neil deactivate the Mousers. During the turtles' exile to Northampton, 
    Donatello becomes obsessed with fixing up and repairing the many broken things within the farmhouse they were living in. Most notably he spent days and 
    nights fixing the boiler to give his family hot running water and builds a windmill and a water wheel to provide electricity. 
    He also finds an old typewriter and writes his own personal credo.

    In the <i>Shades of Grey</i> storyline, Casey Jones encounters the turtle by a ravine as he was pondering "the fractal structure of natural patterns". 
    Casey accuses the turtle of using big words and acting better than everyone else. Donatello suggests they should continue the conversation when Casey is sober. 
    Grabbing a stick, an angry Jones continually pokes the turtle until he loses his temper and sends Casey careening into the water.

    In the <i>City at War</i> storyline, the turtles return to New York to put an end to the Foot Clan's civil war. 
    During a battle with Shredder's Elite Guards in the ruins of the Second Time Around Shop, Donatello falls through the floor and breaks his leg. 
    Seeing their ally Karai subdued and about to be killed, Donatello grabs one of the Foot's machine guns and repeatedly shoots the Foot Elite. Donatello is visibly shaken by the violence and throws the gun away. 
    At the end of the story the turtles, April and Casey move back to New York save for Donatello who chooses to stay in Northampton with <a href="../../project/pages/MasterSplinter.html" title="Master Splinter">Master Splinter</a> to heal from his injury as well as reflect on everything that had happened. 
    After encountering the turtle vigilante ally Nobody in civilian guise he returns with him to New York to help his brothers battle Baxter Stockman.

    <p>
    In the current comics, Donatello finds an armored truck in the sewers which apparently had been part of a bank robbery in the sixties. 
    Along with <a href="../pages/Raphael.html" title="Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Raphael</a> and Casey Jones, he undertakes the task of fixing up the vehicle.
    Donatello decides to accompany the Utroms on a mission to Tepui to search for two missing research teams. 
    The group are attacked by strange wooden creatures who shrink them to miniature size. 
    The creatures turn out to be a group of Utroms which had been stranded in the Jungle during their first stay on Earth and had been living in secret thanks to their Quantum Inversion Redimensioning device which could alter their size. 
    The process could not be reversed on Donatello, possibly due to his mutation, leaving him the size of an action figure. While the Utroms work on returning him to normal, Donatello put his new size to use infiltrating a terrorist organizations warehouse. 
    He's also made a robotic body for him made to resemble a turtle to help him move around.

    <h3><b>Image Comics</b></h3>
    <p> 
    In the comics incarnation of the TMNT, he became a cyborg
    after his body was partially destroyed after he was shot and dropped out of a helicopter
    (he maintained a positive attitude nonetheless, although he was constantly at risk of losing his mind to the cyborg half). He was supposedly killed by Image character Deathwatch by having his brain drained of mutagen. 
    <a href="../pages/Leonardo.html" title="Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Leonardo</a> blamed the cpu of Don's armor for his death; however, 
    Donatello wasn't dead but was separated from his body, and with the help of his brothers he returned to his body. In the independent published series of the Image Comics, Issue #24, 
    Don's armor began to malfunction and was so powerful Donatello was on his last legs until he made a deal with Baxter Stockman who Don was reluctant to work with but had no choice. 
    Donatello is rid of most of his body metal by issue #25 and Baxter informs him his shell had regrown and as a result he was back to being a non-cyborg turtle. 
    Baxter died once more when Don's metal particles wouldn't help restore his body; as a result Baxter requested Donatello give April O'Neil his regards and he died laughing maniacally. 
    Donatello then went on to battle Lady Shredder and the foot clan  with his brothers and Pimiko. Donatello was then by the end of the issue completely rid of all metal particles and had kept his and Baxter's ordeal a secret.

    <h3><b>Arhie's comics</b></h3>
    <p>
    Donatello's appearance in the Archie publications were largely based on the 1987 Fred Wolf incarnation, but with Mirage writers on board at <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures</i> such as Steve Murphy and Ryan Brown, 
    a lot of references to his Mirage counterpart were made. Donatello was showcased to be pure of heart and soul, being able to pass through the Netherworld unscathed. 
    He was also chosen of the Turtles by a group of Aliens known as the Sons of Silence to share their wisdom. He was one of the few who could telepathically communicate with them. 
    Donatello was almost a pacifist, detesting every time he used violence.

    <h3><b>IDW Publishing</b></h3>
    <p>
    In Issue #46, In Harold's lab, Donatello-as-Metalhead finishes prepping his body to be moved to the lair. 
    He's trying his best to put on a brave face (so to speak), but being trapped in a robot body has been an upsetting experience. 
    The Fugitoid tries to help Donnie adapt to having his mind in a robot body while Harold sees to Metalhead’s repairs (the robot having been trashed by Bebop and Rocksteady). 
    Raphael storms off with Alopex following behind him. Raphael starts regretting leaving Donatello behind and seeing him in a robot body is too much for Raphael to handle, 
    but as soon as Alopex and Leonardo give him some comfort he eventually accepts Donatello as Metalhead and he, Leo and Mikey go on patrol while Donatello and the Fugitoid transfer 
    Donnie's turtle body to the lair of the turtles while Harold gets some equipment to help Donatello get back into his own body.
