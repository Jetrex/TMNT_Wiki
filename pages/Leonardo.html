    <h1>Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</h1>
    <!-- Paragraph 1 - Introduction -->

    <p>
    <b>Leonardo</b>, nicknamed <b>Leo</b>, is a fictional superhero and one of the four main characters in the comics and related media.
    </p>

    <p>
    He is often depicted wearing a blue bandanna. His signature weapons are two Ninjatos, commonly confused as Katanas. 
    Leonardo is the eldest brother and the leader of the group. He is the most skilled, the most serious, the most spiritual, 
    the most disciplined and the most in-line with Splinter's teachings and thoughts. 
    Like all of the brothers, he is named after a Renaissance artist, in this case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. 
    Da Vinci is widely considered the most diversely skilled individual of the Renaissance period, and as such Leonardo is also considered the most diversely skilled ninja turtle. 
    In the original comics, all the turtles wore red masks, but by the creators to tell them apart, he was written and redrawn to have an ocean-blue mask.

    <h3><b>Mirage Comics</b></h3>
    <p>
 
    Leonardo is depicted as the main protagonist of the turtles. He never explicitly referred to himself as leader in the early stories, 
    except in issue #44 ("The Violent Underground"). He is the one to usually take charge of the turtles when <a href="../pages/MasterSplinter.html" title="Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Master Splinter</a> is not present.
     He is often at odds with his more hot-headed younger brother <a href="../pages/Raphael.html" title="Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Raphael</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In <i>Leonardo</i> #1, Leonardo goes out for a run on the rooftops of New York City and is ambushed by the Foot Clan.
    He puts up an admirable fight against an army of Foot Ninja, but is eventually overwhelmed. Beaten to near unconsciousness, he is thrown through April O'Neil's apartment window.
    The remaining Turtles and Splinter are forced to continue the fight, but even with the aid of Casey Jones, the odds are against them. 
    In the end, the building catches fire and the police arrive, but they secretly escape to Northampton. 
    During this time, Leonardo recovers from his physical wounds. However, he lost a great deal of confidence. He repeatedly attempts, unsuccessfully, to hunt for deer.
    While out hunting, he sees April fall through ice into a lake, and he rescues her. In subsequent issues, it is implied that Leonardo has regained most of his confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the <i>Return to New York</i> storyline (<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> (vol. 1) #19-21), Raphael demands that the Turtles return to New York to confront the Foot Clan and the Shredder.
    He accuses Leonardo of cowardice, and the arguing brothers soon come to blows. Leonardo is beaten by Raphael, who throws Leonardo through the wall of the barn and leaves alone.
    Along with his younger brother <a href="../pages/Donatelo.html" title="Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Donatello</a> and his youngest brother <a href="../pages/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">Michelangelo</a>, 
    Leonardo returns to New York and reunites with his wayward brother in the old sewer lair. The three go along with Raphael's plan to storm the Foot Headquarters, where once again Raphael goes off on his own to fight the Shredder.
    However, he is ambushed and beaten by the Shredder's Elite guard, but is rescued by Leonardo. This prompts Raphael to finally cede to Leonardo's leadership, leaving him to fight the Shredder. 
    Leonardo engages in a bloody battle with Shredder that spills out onto the rooftop of the building. Leonardo ends the battle by decapitating the Shredder just as the building implodes. 
    The Turtles later burn the Shredder's corpse in a funeral pyre in a nearby Manhattan harbor.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the <i>City at War</i> storyline (<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> (vol. 1) #50-62), a feud between various factions of the Foot Clan over leadership breaks out.
    As fighting ensues in the streets of New York, the Turtles and the civilian populace get caught in the middle. Leonardo grows weary of constant battle with the Foot Clan and seems fraught with indecision.
    The Turtles are approached by Karai, the leader of the Foot Clan in Japan who has come to New York to unite the Foot. She presents the Turtles with an offer of a truce between the Foot and the Turtles if they help her kill Shredder's Elite Guards,
    which are a major obstacle to her reorganizing the Foot. Despite Raphael's objections, Leonardo persuades his brothers to accept Karai's offer and all four Turtles successfully work with Karai to eliminate the Elite Guard.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Volume 2 of the Mirage Studios comic, the turtles begin living in separate places. 
    Leonardo decides to live in a newfound sewer lair. Michelangelo and Raphael notice a change in Leonardo and note that he seems more easygoing, 
    though Raphael points out that his and Leonardo's natural order is to be "buttin' heads."
    </p>

    <p>
    Years later in Volume 4, Leonardo still leads his brothers (all four now in their thirties) in fights against crime. 
    Leonardo and Raphael's conflict seems to have greatly lessened. When the Utroms make a very public arrival on Earth and reveal alien life to humans, 
    however, the Turtles become free to mingle in everyday society. The Turtles also help the Utroms acclimate to life on Earth and work alongside the Foot Clan as security. 
    One Foot Clan member is Cha Ocho, who Leonardo has a rivalry with due to an encounter years earlier. Karai approaches Leonardo for help when a mysterious force begins attacking various Foot Clans; 
    only the New York branch is left intact. His investigation takes him to the Battle Nexus, where he meets Oroku Yoshi (who wears armor similar to the Shredder's).
    </p>

    <p>This incarnation of Leonardo makes an appearance in the <i>Turtles Forever</i> crossover special voiced by Jason Griffith.

    <h3><b>Image Comics</b></h3>
    <p>
  
    In Volume 3 of the Image Comics series, Leonardo was initially portrayed as similar to his Mirage counterpart (at the time, Image was picking up where Volume 2 left off). 
    In the later issues, he lost a hand when it was eaten by King Komodo, although this did not seem to deter him significantly. He tried initially to use a prosthetic hand, 
    which was given to him by Donatello, but he much preferred to wear a steel cap which came with a retractable blade. In the official IDW-published conclusion, 
    TMNT Urban Legends 25, after an altercation with Lady Shredder which smashed his steel cap beyond use, Leonardo's hand was found to have grown back.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Archie comics</b></h3>
    <p>
   
    The Archie Comics series initially began as an adaptation of 1987 animated series, so Leonardo was naturally portrayed like his animated counterpart.
    As the series progressed, it began telling original stories. Leonardo demonstrated a rather strong dislike for firearms. Also, a future version of Leonardo was depicted,
    having founded a ninja school. Four of his top students were depicted: Nobuko, possibly his love interest; Miles, a young black man; Carmen, a Latina woman and possibly his love interest;
    and Bob, an anthropomorphic baboon. These students seemed to have an "extended family" relationship with the Turtles, Bob in particular referring to them as uncles.
    </p>

    <h3><b>IDW Publishing</b></h3>
    <p>
    
    Although the IDW series is a complete comic re-imagination of the franchise, Leonardo is initially portrayed as similar to his Mirage counterpart.
    Leonardo is the eldest brother and the leader of the four. In the <i>Cityfall</i> saga, he gets captured by the Foot while he and his brothers try to save Casey 
    and is taken to a Shinto witch by the name of Kitsune, who uses her strong dark magic to brainwash him into working for Shredder as his chunin (second-in-command), 
    which infuriates Karai. He is later saved by his brothers and their allies, however, after the death of the Shredder at the hands of his father, Splinter,
    who took over the Foot Clan after the battle, Leo once again became the chunin, but, like last time, it didn't last. The relationship between Splinter and his sons 
    deteriorated after he decided to take another life, going against the very philosophy he taught them to always follow. He revealed that this was, in fact, 
    an intentional way of pushing them away from him, as he believes being around him would be too much of a threat to them, as shown during the events of the comic book. 
    Leonardo assumed leadership over the Clan Hamato, and since then, they've come into conflict with the Foot Clan several times.
